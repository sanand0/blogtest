![Books in 2021](/blog/assets/image-71.webp)

On my Goodreads 2021 reading challenge, I read [52/50 books in 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26020960). I managed [47/50 in 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621) (see [2020 reviews](/blog/books-in-2020/)) and [26/24 in 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/15183844).

Here's what I read (best books first).

**Mind-blowing**

1. [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54898389-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant). It's the **best non-fiction** I've read in 5 years. It focuses Wealth and Happiness. It's short. I finished it in a day. But it's deep. I can spend a decade practicing just a single sentence. It's available at [navalmanack.com](http://ec2-52-26-194-35.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/x/d?c=12394515&l=90b1a7d0-4d2b-474d-bdf1-5680c654c26b&r=f44ebee2-4dbc-412b-8443-e690d552e1a4) as a free e-book and audio book.
2. [Rhythm of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250966-rhythm-of-war). The 4th book of the [Stormlight Archives](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive) is an action-packed fantasy. A great gift for teenagers. In an extra-ordinary magic system, Brandon Sanderson builds up to the greatest climax I've read. **What an ending!**
3. [Death Note #1-#12](https://www.goodreads.com/series/52807-death-note). Light Yagami gets hold of a “death note”. If he writes a name on it, they die. “L” is out to catch him. In a cat-and-mouse **psychological thriller**, Light and L work next to each other, share their plans, and still try to outwit the other. It’s like chess. The pieces are visible. But it's the strategy that counts. A brilliant comic series.

**Life-changing**

1. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). A systematic, well-researched approach to creating (and stopping) habits that last. It's the **best "Habits" book** in the market right now..
2. [Being Mortal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal). A thoughtful, practical guide on dealing with old age. Must read **for those with aging parents**. It helps that Atul Gawande is a great storyteller and draws from his personal experiences.
3. [Originals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614523-originals). Teaches you **how to be more creative** and take risks safely. If [Creativity Inc](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc) inspired you, this book is a way to build Pixar's magic into your teams. An easy-to-read piece by Adam Grant, backed by solid research.
4. [Combatting Cult Mind Control](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173711.Combatting_Cult_Mind_Control). The gold-standard in knowing when someone's in a cult, and how to **escape the cult**. Opened up a whole new world for me.
5. [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad). Teaches you to **make money work for you** rather than you working for money. I was shocked when I realized that the middle class buys liabilities (a house to live in) while the rich buy assets (a house to rent out).
6. [Think Again](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55539565-think-again). Teaches you how to **stop fooling yourself and avoid blindspots** by checking your assumptions, enjoy learning from mistakes, and open up people's minds -- especially your own. Yet another easy-to-read piece by Adam Grant, backed by solid research.
7. [Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence). A research-backed guide on the science of **influencing people subconsciously**. Reciprocity, consistency, social proof, authority, scarcity -- these are signals we react to unknowingly.
8. [Dawnshard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard). Book #3.5 of the [Stormlight Archives](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive). A handicapped shipowner and her winged reptile pet travel to a mysterious island that no one returns from. With a typical Brandon Sanderson climax that moves this from "interesting" to "life changing".
9. [From Data to Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59901913-from-data-to-stories). The first & only comic data story book, with step-by-step cricket analysis explained by comic characters. This was written by [Gramener's Story Labs team](https://gramener.com/storylabs/) using [Comicgen](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) characters.

**Interesting**

1. [The First Law #1-#3](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43644-the-first-law). Joe Abercrombie. A wizard assembles 3 flawed heroes for a quest.
2. [Shoe Dog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27220736-shoe-dog). The Nike founder story.
3. [Skin In The Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36064445-skin-in-the-game). On accountability & commitment.

5. [Sycamore Row](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17288661-sycamore-row). John Grisham. An old man's will leaves everything to his servant.

7. [The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077476-the-psychology-of-money). How to make money work for you than the other way around.
8. [Detective William Warwick #2-#4](https://www.goodreads.com/series/259121-detective-william-warwick). Jeffrey Archer. More adventures from Dt. Warwick.
9. [Zoom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78991.Zoom). A wordless book that zooms out on every successive page, and nothing is what it appears.

**How I read books**

1. **Select**. I add book recommendations on my [GoodReads - to read list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39713492-s-anand?order=d&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read&sort=avg_rating). Then I sort by rating and pick the first one I like to read.
2. **Listen**. I listen to non-fiction audiobooks during walks.
3. **Read**: I read fiction as ePUBs on my laptop or phone.
4. **Stop**: I stop reading books that are boring, with no guilt. I've better things to do.

  Greetings Anand sir .. I was a student at upGrad and have seen your lecture videos. I was impressed by the way you communicate and share your knowledge. I started following you on LinkedIn and twitter. Working at Gramener is one of my ambitions. Reading is my hobby too and currently I am reading the Atomic Habits by James Clear. When I saw your post and the books choices, especially the way you pick up a book, I so identified with it. So writing this message. Thanks for sharing.
