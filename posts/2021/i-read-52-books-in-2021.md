I read 52 #books in 2021.

The best #nonfiction was The Almanack of Naval Ravikant. Succinct & deep. I can spend a decade practicing every sentence.

The best #fiction was Brandon Sanderson's Rhythm of War. A brilliantly rich magic system, and what a plot, what an ending!

My one-line #reviews of the books are below.
