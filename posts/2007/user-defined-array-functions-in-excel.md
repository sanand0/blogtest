Many languages have functions to process lists (array). These functions usually return a list, so you can pass that to another list function. This chaining of functions is really powerful.

UNIX provides this sort of chaining capability. If I had a cities (with some repetitions) and I wanted to find out how many started with the letter 'A', I'd just type:

```bash
cat cities | sort | uniq | grep "^A" | wc
```

```yaml
cat: types the cities.
sort: sorts the cities alphabetically.
uniq: finds unique cities (works only if sorted - that's why we had to sort the list).
grep: filters the cities. Only allows cities beginning with A.
wc: word count
```

To do this on Excel, the only way is to

1. **get the unique values**. Data - Filter - Advanced Filter, and select "Unique records only", "Copy the list to another location", and select a location
2. **get the first letter**. =LEFT(cell,1) returns the first letter of the cell.
3. **count the number of "A"s**. =COUNT(range, "A") counts the number of "A"s.

But ideally, I'd like a 1-line formula like

```excel
=LENGTH(UNIQUE(GREP("^A", range)))
```

Excel doesn't provide these functions by default, but you can add them as [user defined functions](/blog/user-defined-functions-in-excel/). Doing this **lets you condense several cells into one**. Instead of having to copy all your data into a set of unique values, and then adding a column for the first cell, the entire operation can be condensed into one formula.

I consider the following functions the a basic set for list processing.

- LENGTH(list) counts the number of elements in a list
- INDEX(list, n) returns the nth element of the list
- GREP(string, list) returns elements of the list that have the string
- UNIQUE(list) filters unique values
- UNION(list, list) returns elements in at least one of the lists
- INTERSECTION(list, list) returns elements in both lists
- DIFFERENCE(list, list) returns the elements in the first list but not the second
- REVERSE(list) reverses the order of the list
- STRJOIN(separator, list) joins the elements of the list into a string, separated by a separator
- STRSPLIT(separator, string) splits the string into a list, using a separator
- MVLOOKUP(value, lookup, result) looks up value in "lookup", and returns the corresponding MULTIPLE values from "result"

I created these UDFs. You can [download the functions](https://files.s-anand.net/blog/a/Macros.xls) and play with them. Below are some tasks that you can do with them, that are difficult otherwise.

- Get the file name from a path.
  ```excel
  ```

=INDEX(REVERSE(STRSPLIT("\", filename)), 1)

````
- Count the number of unique elements in a range.
  ```excel
=LENGTH(UNIQUE(range))
````

- How many common elements are there in range 1 and range 2?
  ```excel
  ```

=LENGTH(INTERSECTION(range1, range2))

````
- How many words are there in a string?
  ```excel
=LENGTH(STRSPLIT(" ", string))
````

- Get the smallest unique numbers in a range
  ```excel
  ```

=SMALL(UNIQUE(range), 5)

````
- Count the number of mismatches between two lists.
  ```excel
=COUNT(Range1)+COUNT(Range2) - COUNT(INTERSECTION(Range1,Range2))
````

- Get a list of mismatches between two lists.
  ```excel
  ```

=STRJOIN(",",UNION(DIFFERENCE(Range1,Range2), DIFFERENCE(Range2,Range1)))

````
- Count duplicate entries in a range.
  ```excel
=LENGTH(Range)-LENGTH(UNIQUE(Range))
````

- VLOOKUP multiple values
  ```excel
  ```

=MVLOOKUP(A1,Lookup_Range,Return_Range)

````
- Count the unique matches in a VLOOKUP
  ```excel
=COUNT(UNIQUE(MVLOOKUP(A1,Lookup_Range,Return_Range)
````

This is a small sample. The power of list processing is phenomenal, especially when combined with array formulas. [Download these macros](https://files.s-anand.net/blog/a/Macros.xls) and play with them!

  Hi I reproduce this extract from your article "Instead of having to copy all your data into a set of unique values, and then adding a column for the first cell, the entire operation can be condensed into one formula" can you explain why a column has to be added for the first cell ?
