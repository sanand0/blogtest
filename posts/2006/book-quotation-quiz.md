These are quotes from books. How many titles can you guess? (Case insensitive. Ignore punctuation. So "Hitchhiker's" is "Hitchhikers" without the apostrophe. Don't forget the leading "A" and "The". Harry Potter books begin with "Harry Potter and the...".)

Anything over 10 / 25 is impressive.

  Anand Man... LOTR is one book in three parts and not a trilogy. So LOTR is the correct answer to a couple of questions instead of ROTK etc.

  Hmmm, a particular quote occurs in more than one Ludlum novels. In fact, I suspect that particular one is there in all the three.

  Finally got 17 / 25. But I suspect that is because we have been reading similar stuff lately.

  Agreed: LOTR is a single book. Loved it so much I had to put in a quote from each part!

  Actually, LOTR is not 1 book. JRR Tokein actually wrote it as three different books. We now read it as one. I read this in the first few pages of the first book.

  Um, well, 'Cain is for Charlie and Delta is for Cain' is only used in The Bourne Identity. Supremacy has 'Cain is for Carlos and Delta is for Cain', while Ultimatum hasn't got it.
