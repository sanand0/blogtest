  Then do u still think we shud support these?
- **S Anand** _19 May 2006 5:35 pm_:
  Doesn't look like anyone's earning any money out of it -- so it may not be a matter of support. I guess at best we can choose not to download these.

  Oops :). did not realize that angle. Had felt happy for having found a cool medium.

  Yes Anand. Makes sense. It wud be so unfair on our part to enjoy some nice works without having to pay for it.
