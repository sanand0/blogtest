I always wondered why **old movies are rated so high** on IMDb.

For example, 12 Angry Men (1954) with just ~900K votes ranks about as high as Inception (2010) with ~2M votes. Few people I know have seen 12 Angry Men. So where does this high rating come from?

My theories were:

- Old movies really _are_ that good.
- IMDb's algorithm is biased towards old movies.
- People remember older movies fondly.

Actually, it's none of these. **It**'**s selection bias**.

Few people watch a 1950s black & white drama: cinephiles, film students, etc. They love it and give it 9s and 10s.

Everyone watched Inception. The casual majority thinks it's fine, not life changing. Maybe a 7 or 8.

This creates a paradox: **obscurity protects ratings** while **popularity is its own punishment**. Only "devotees" watch obscure movies - leading to better ratings than widely seen movies.
