I joined Madhu Sathiaseelan's podcast to talk about LLM Psychology.

But it's also fascinating to see how much SECONDARY content you can generate from a video.

Do you prefer sketch-notes? See Nano Banana Pro's version below.

Or are you a slides person? https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-11-06-llm-psychology/

How about a Malcolm Gladwell article? https://github.com/sanand0/talks/raw/refs/heads/main/2025-11-06-llm-psychology/mind-readers.docx

Or reading the raw transcript? https://github.com/sanand0/talks/tree/main/2025-11-06-llm-psychology

The way in which we consume information is entirely up to us. This is making a lot more content (e.g. research papers, government regulations, medical reports, policy documents, product manuals, ...) accessible to me - just by asking it to rewrite it as a sketch-note, slides, article, or anything I prefer.
