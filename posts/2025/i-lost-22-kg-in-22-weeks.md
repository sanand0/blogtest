I lost 22 kg in 22 weeks.

**How**? Skipped lunch, no snacking. (That's all.)

**Why**? Cholesterol.

**When**? Since 1 Jan 2025. I plan to continue.

**How far**? At 64 kg, I'm at 22 BMI. I'll aim for 60 kg.

**Is fasting** 12 **hours OK**? Ankor Rai shared Dr. Mindy Pelz's chart that fasting benefits truly kick in after 36 hours. Long way for me to go.

**No exercise**? Exercise is great for fitness & happiness. Not weight loss. Read John Walker's The Hacker's Diet.

**No LLMs stuff this post**? Of course! I vibe coded the data extraction, analysis and visualization with Claude Code for my VizChitra talk:
