AI agents are messing up software tool learning.

Normally, we need to pass stages of competence:

KNOW what you can do\
LEARN how to do it\
EXECUTE it.

Excel: **KNOW** you can summarize by category, **LEARN** pivot tables, **EXECUTE** an Insert → PivotTable → select data range → drag ...

Photoshop: **KNOW** you can erase objects, **LEARN** Content-Aware Fill, **EXECUTE** Lasso tool → select → Edit → Content-Aware Fill → ...

**AI agents collapse these stages**. Especially with command line tools.

For example, I did not **KNOW** ffmpeg could visualize audio, nor **LEARN** the complex filters, nor **EXECUTE** it on my laptop.

Instead, I told Claude to _Visualize this audio clip creatively in multiple ways_. It generated a dozen stunning visualizations of this Why This Kolaveri clip: https://lnkd.in/g7vfcPEs

I didn't KNOW ⮕ LEARN ⮕ EXECUTE. I did an EXECUTE ⮕ KNOW ⮕ don't bother to LEARN.

Since that's possible, my prompts are now like: "I don't know what I want. Guess my desires. Fulfill them. Show me. Then maybe I'll know what I want."

Which is fantastic! But on the other hand, this **TOTALLY** messes up how I teach software tools...
