I _used to be_ a data visualization expert. I'm not sure I still am.

When Anthropic published an article about how AI is transforming their engineers' work, I ran this prompt:

> Suggest how the following engineer productivity patterns can be illustrated using interactive animated charts, graphs, or infographics.
>
> Be diverse. Xenographics are welcome. Novel animation* / *interaction styles, artistry, xenographics, and diverse chart types are encouraged.
>
> Be intuitive. A single glance should tell them exactly what insight we are trying to convey.

**Its suggestions were better than mine**.

Gemini 3 Pro was the best, followed by Claude (Opus/Sonnet 4.5) and then ChatGPT (GPT 5.2). They came up with:

- a _Throughput Flow_ showing commits as particles, going from a trickle to a stream
- a _Knowledge Neural Net_ where an engineer's mental model transforms from isolated clusters into a dense mesh
- a _Dark Matter Radar_ detecting invisible tasks, a _Feedback Pulse_, a polyomino task stacking
- ... and more.

I have ~20 years of professional data visualization experience. I teach it. And these AIs just casually suggested more creative visualization ideas in 10-30 minutes than I probably would have come up with in a day.

This cost less than $2. The new per-day-rate for my expertise, I guess.

Luckily: **my expertise has two parts**.

- Part 1: **Ideating innovative visualizations**.
- Part 2: **Selecting the right one for the job**.

**AI**'**s better at ideation**. It's **fast** and can generate creative ideas faster than I can sketch on a whiteboard. It **knows** xenographics and every visualization ever made and can **recombine** them in novel ways.

**I**'**m better at selection**. For now. Knowing which visualization requires knowing the audience, context, and intent. **It requires taste** (accumulated wisdom from showing the wrong chart to the wrong audience enough times).

But still, since AI can ideate, anyone can create innovative visualizations. No 20-years of experience, reading Edward Tufte's books, or comparing a violin plot and a beeswarm. Just tell the story and AI will suggest ten creative ways to tell it. Take your pick.

I'm no longer a bottleneck.
