![Books in 2025](https://files.s-anand.net/images/2025-books.webp)

I read 51 books in 2025 (about the same as in [2024](/blog/books-in-2024/), [2023](/blog/books-in-2023/), [2022](/blog/books-in-2022/), and [2021](/blog/books-in-2021/).)

With a difference: [I used AI to read](/blog/i-count-ai-summarized-books-as-read/) 44 of them in the last week of the year.

**Mind blowing**

- [The Ants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115013.The_Ants) by Bert Hölldobler. Finally, after 20 years of wanting to read it. It lives up to the hype.
- [Wind and Truth (The Stormlight Archive, #5)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203578847-wind-and-truth) by Brandon Sanderson. The only fiction I've taken notes for. (About 500 points.)
