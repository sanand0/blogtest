I didn't know that Nehru rescued Mountbatten's daughter from the crowd when hoisting the flag on Independence Day (1947).

Something I learnt when prompting Nano Banana Pro to "Create a sketch note about the night of the Indian Independence on 15 Aug 1947 - keep it funny yet grounded in history."

Once again, I can't find any spelling mistakes.
