Nano Banano Pro has **excellent** text generation (though it doesn't always give you what you want in the first try).

I couldn't spot any errors in the generated text. Can you?

I used this prompt (with the workshop details and my photo): _Create a professional poster for the below, including all relevant information. Use my photo (attached) professionally_.

The NPTEL workshop is real, BTW. First 100 seats, I think. You can register here: https://elearn.nptel.ac.in/shop/iit-workshops/ongoing/computer-science/applied-vibe-coding-workshop/
