![I count AI summarized books as "Read"](/blog/assets/Gemini_Generated_Image_pxk28epxk28epxk2.webp)

I have this nagging feeling (maybe you do too?) that **it's cheating** and **I'm not really learning** if it's so easy. The same voice makes me feel guilty when using coding agents to code or ChatGPT in meetings.

I'm telling that voice to relax.

I upload books to Claude and ask it to "Comprehensively and engagingly summarize and fact-check, writing in Malcolm Gladwell's style, the book …". I can read it in an hour instead of twelve. Four bullet points instead of forty. With (this surprised me) roughly the same number of insights I actually **do something with**.

I read books for pleasure, learning, and implementing.

That last bit is key, but the bottleneck isn't the book. It's me: how much I can absorb, retain, and act on. From what I can tell, between reading 300 pages vs 10, there's not much difference.

**The pleasure is intact**

I worried I'd lose the emotional jolt -- those mind-blown moments that make reading feel worth it. For science and self-help books, I haven't.

For example, take this summary excerpt of [How Minds Change](https://claude.ai/share/25283a55-9f6f-408d-9080-1a7b1c3d8a3e)

> The irony is almost too perfect. To change someone's mind, you have to stop trying to change their mind. You have to start by trying to understand it.\
> And when you do that—really do that—something unexpected happens. Sometimes their mind changes. And sometimes, if you're honest with yourself, **yours does too**.

That blew my mind for a good 10 minutes.

Or, from [Ants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115013.The_Ants):

> Think of a leafcutter ant colony as a high-tech Fungus Farm. There are four main players in this system: two are partners, one is a bodyguard, and one is a villain.

I **loved** the villain part!

**There's a learning bonus: fact-checking**

When I ask Claude to fact-check the book while summarizing, I learn **beyond** the book. For example, I learnt that, [among these longevity books](https://claude.ai/share/f7555a9c-3f6a-4f3c-a56a-ee3d9384d324):

- [Lifespan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43723901-lifespan) is largely rubbish.
- [The Telomere Effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34458942-the-telomere-effect) has a decent core but builds fancy castles on shaky foundations.
- [Outlive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive) is more careful with its claims, though less ambitious.

I learned this **during** the reading, not months later when some podcast corrected me.

You can also just… ask questions.

- While reading [Ants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115013.The_Ants), "OK, aren't most species superorganisms then? If yes, what's the big deal?"
- While reading [The Cancer Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52163526-the-cancer-code), "Why are free radicals produced? Give me examples. Are they always oxygen molecules that lack electrons? ELI15."

The book doesn't do that. The summary can. (I'm loving the ELI15 responses, BTW.)

**I can read inaccessible books**

I can now read [Kamba Ramayanam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramavataram) in Tamil (a script I read **quite** slowly). Or [Gitanjali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitanjali), [The Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad), [Dream of the Red Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber), or more.

It's not just language. I can read boring or intimidating books. [On Growth and Form](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460984.On_Growth_and_Form). [The Road to Reality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10638.The_Road_to_Reality). [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33930.The_Structure_of_Evolutionary_Theory). Brilliant but unapproachable.

Heck, I managed to read [Ants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115013.The_Ants) after 30 years!

Sometimes the very first line of a summary hooks me so hard I can't stop reading. That's a strange thing to admit about a summary. But there it is.

**I haven't figured it out fully**

I would read Brandon Sanderson or Jeffrey Archer this way yet. The point is the experience itself: the slow unfolding, the surprise, the voice in your ear. They write in a style I like. Why summarize that?

**Biographies** are trickier. [The Choice's summary](https://claude.ai/share/a972c2a2-ab27-4470-b2b2-74c4d7a92eea) made me cry. So, I do want to read [The Choice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753738-the-choice) in original - and the summary helped me prioritize it.

**Histories**? I'm not sure. **Manga**? No way.

**[I'm logging these on Goodreads as "read".](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39713492-s-anand?order=d&shelf=read&sort=date_read)** I don't know if that's kosher. The voice in my head has opinions. But I'm learning things I wouldn't have learned otherwise, from books I wouldn't have finished or started, with the same pleasure and actionability.

Maybe that's cheating. But maybe the rules of our game have changed, and I haven't learned them yet.
