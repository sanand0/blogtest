Here's how I use ChatGPT, based on the ~6,000 conversations I've had in 2 years.

My top use, by far, is for **technology**. "Modern JavaScript Coding" and "Python Coding Questions" are ~30% of my queries. There's a long list with Markdown, GitLab, GitHub, Shell, D3, Auth, JSON, CSS, DuckDB, SQLite, Pandas, FFMPeg, etc. featured prominently.

Next is to **brainstorm AI use**: "AI Panel Discussions", "AI Trends and Business Impact", "LLM Applications and DSLs", "Industry Use Cases and Metrics" are also fast growing categories. I brainstorm talk outlines, refine slide deck narratives, and plan business ideas.

Thirdly, I use it for **reading/writing**. "Article Summaries and Insights", "Writing Style and Editing".

Lastly, for **personal advice**. "Personal Advice and Replies" and "Singapore Travel Queries" are in this bucket.

Then there are niches like **image generation** ("Image Generation and Annotation", "Calvin and Hobbes Comics"), **research** ("Fact Checking and Trivia"), **emails** ("Email Analysis and Spam Detection"), and **teaching** ("Education and Student Projects").

6,000 chats saved me perhaps 600 hours. ChatGPT's "given" me a month of life-time for $600 -- which I reinvested into teaching and tinkering.

Today, 70% of my prompts are code. In five years, that might drop as AI handles coding, and I tackle strategy and thinking. My prompt portfolio **isn't future-proof**? Is yours?

There's no finance, music, or philosophy. My prompts mirror my **blind spots**. Should I force one prompt a week in a category I've never explored? Would you?
