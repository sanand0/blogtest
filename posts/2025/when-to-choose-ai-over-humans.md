I charted the [OpenAI GDPVal paper](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) with industry compensation as the size and AI augmentation as color. Big green areas are we're paying people where AI does better.

Clicking to see some actual tasks compared.

I use this to check whom to ask advice: AI or professional.

**AI beats Personal Financial Advisors** ~64% of the time. So I invested half my money using ChatGPT's recommendation. (UTI Nifty 50, if you're curious.)

**Accountants beat AI** 76% of the time. So my tax returns are still filed by [Ventura Pranas](https://venturapranas.com/).

**AI beats Government** - Administrative Services Managers 62% of the time. I haven't figured out how to bypass them yet. Nor customer service representatives.

Overall, AI beats most managers and clerks, not industrial engineers and pharmacists.

Here's my current thought where I wouldn't hire AI if a **high portion** of their work

1. Has **legal liability** (e.g. pharmacist/judge vs shop attendant/lawyer)
2. Is **subjective** (e.g. perfumer/auction appraiser vs lab chemist/insurance appraiser)
3. Needs rapid contextual **decisions** (e.g. detective/fireman/ER vs parking enforcer)

But this apart, if they charged half, would their demand double? If so, even with AI, they'll have more demand.
