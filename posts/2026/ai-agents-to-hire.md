[GDPval](https://sanand0.github.io/datastories/gdpval/) is a benchmark that compares how well AI does (vs experts without AI) on useful real-world tasks.

In several areas, the _agents outperform experts_.

For example, AI beats personal financial advisors, but not accountants and auditors. So I used ChatGPT / Claude to decide where to invest, but am having an accountant file my taxes. That's a high leverage activity, especially since I might not have hired a personal financial advisor by default, and ChatGPT is certainly better than me (I'm not an expert) at personal financial advice.

Financial management is just one aspect of life. There are several. I don't hire professionals in many areas where I'm not an expert, so hiring AI agents here is almost a no-brainer.

- Doctor: Symptom triage, report analysis, drug check, health planning.
- Financial advisor: Budgeting, investing, tax saving.
- Lawyer: Contract review (rental, employment, ...), disputes (claims, employment, property), planning (will, power of attorney), legal compliance.
- Real-estate broker: Property search, lease negotiation, regulatory compliance.
- Editor: Presentations, documents, emails, code.
- Investigator: Client, vendor, partner, competitor, consultant, product.
- Teacher: Skill development, test prep, concept learning, project guidance.
- Counselor: Mental health, relationship, career, life coaching.

But these are the more obvious ones. I had [Claude list what AI agents can be "hired"](https://claude.ai/share/d32e5416-f603-46f3-8a29-e2938b05c607) of some of the less obvious but high-leverage "hires" and what I could ask them:
