AI image generation still has a _long_ way to go. Here are two images generated by Gemini and ChatGPT from the same prompt: "Create a funny scrabble board of dysfunctional family relationships!"

### Gemini <!-- https://gemini.google.com/u/2/app/c21208572328a890 -->

It's probably showing off, spelling "DYSFUNCTIONAL" right. But "ABLOMY"? "PASSIAVE"? "RGUCT_SVA"? "SORDSP"? Most of the vertical letters are wrong. Some horizontals ("DTENSION"?) are off, too.

Also: "Z" has 2 points? "C" has "C" points? "DOUBLE STTER SCORE"? "UUT SCORE SCORE" instead of "TRIPLE WORD SCORE"?

But one thing is clear, the number of times "DOUBLE STTER SCORE" appears indicates that it does some mental copy-pasting!

### ChatGPT <!-- https://chatgpt.com/c/695d16e3-2894-8322-b694-22c24c0af6c3 -->

This is almost as bad. "FAKEHUY"? "MREGSUUEAHL"? The verticals are worse than the horizontals, but some horizontals are off, too. "DISAPPOINTI"? "THERPY"?

"INLAWS" are hanging outside the board. The "TRIPLE WORD" at the bottom right and bottom left are not at the corners, and are missing a "SCORE". More importantly, some of the letters aren't printed right.

Overall, slightly fewer errors, but slightly poorer style, too.
