Straive turned on [Chrome Enterprise Premium](https://chromeenterprise.google/products/chrome-enterprise-premium/) on my browser. This means:

- No extensions or DevTools.
- No downloading, copying, or printing (of work stuff).
- No incognito mode.
- Every page, text pasted, file attached, is sent to the admin.

Since Edge is my primary browser, I now open Chrome for office work only when needed. So, my guess is:

- I'll check mail/chat less frequently.
- I'll have fewer client documents to review.
- I'll have fewer demos I can build.

This might make me _more_ productive - though it's probably not what was intended.
