My [Tools in Data Science course](https://tds.s-anand.net/) is available publicly, with a few changes from last year.

First, I **removed all the content**! Last year, Claude generated teaching material using my prompts. But what's the point? I might as well give students the prompts directly. They can tweak it to their needs.

This time, TDS shares the **questions** needed to learn a topic. Any AI will give you good answers.

Second, it focuses on **what AI does NOT do well**. Coding syntax? Who cares. Basic analysis? ChatGPT can do that. In fact, each question now has an "Ask AI" button that dumps the question into your favorite AI tool. Just paste the answer and move on.

**But**, these questions (hopefully) teach you _where AI fails_. Putting tools together, prompting well, debugging and evaluating the output, etc. These matter more.

Third, it's **easier to audit**. Anyone can take the course, even outside IITM. You can join the [public Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/tds-iitm) for announcements. All [questions are discussed publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/discussions).

So, check the new version out, learn, and please share feedback!
