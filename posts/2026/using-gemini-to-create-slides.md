On Friday, our data & analytics client-facing teams connected [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) to their [Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and [Email](https://mail.google.com/):

1. Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
2. Make sure you see a "Pro" icon on the top right. (Some already had access. Some enabled it by clicking stuff.)
3. Go to Settings & help > Connected apps. Turn on "Google Workspace" and approve access.
4. Select "Pro" as the model (instead of "Fast" or "Thinking").

Then they ran this a prompt like this:

> Go through my Google Drive and find out what are the recent sales proposals we've picthed or new clients we've won.

⭐ Gemini searches **all** your files (even shared ones) and emails (even attachments) and shares a summary.

They tried using it to gather material to respond to client requests (potentially attaching documents):

> Share all relevant material to respond to (details of topic) from my Google Drive / Email.

⭐ Gemini is as smart as a good business analyst at scanning files and gathering material.

They went further, and prompted it to convert it to a slide deck:

> Convert this into a beautiful slide deck, McKinsey style.
> Make the slides content rich, i.e. clear and self-explanatory with enough detail to help the audience understand without a narrator.
> Use iconography, typography, stock images, etc. as appropriate.

⭐ Gemini can create reasonably good slide drafts that you can export to Google Slides and edit.

In 30 minutes, several people had created beautiful slide decks with no support! So now they can:

- Create a first version, show it to analysts and say "Build something like this. But change ..."
  - Or, just tell Gemini "But change ..."
- Create half a dozen drafts and pick what they like

But what excites me more is when we:

- Create and share the deck overnight. Lightning-fast turnaround with no support!
- Create the deck _during_ a client meeting. It's like we came prepared reading clients' thoughts!
- Create _with_ the friendly client something _they_ are happy to take to their bosses!
