[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) lets you copy individual responses as Markdown, but not an entire conversation.

That's useful if you want to save the chat for later, pass it to another LLM, or publish it.

So I built a [bookmarklet](https://tools.s-anand.net/geminiscraper/) that scrapes the entire conversation as Markdown and copies it to the clipboard.

**SETUP**: Drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.

**USAGE**: On a Gemini chat page, click the bookmarklet. It copies the chat as Markdown.

Here's a sample output:

**NOTE**: When I vibe coded this at first, I got an error that made me think Gemini's [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) prevents executing `javascript:` URLs. But on testing, the CSP actually looks like:

```text
Content-Security-Policy: ...; script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data:; ...
```

This specifically allows `unsafe-inline` scripts, which is what bookmarklets are. So it works fine.
