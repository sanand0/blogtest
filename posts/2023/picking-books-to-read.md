![Picking books to read](/blog/assets/book-hunter-1.webp)

I add book recommendations to my [GoodReads – To-read list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39713492-s-anand?order=d&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read&sort=avg_rating). Then I sort by rating and pick the first one I like to read.

In 2023, I'm [reshaping my environment](/blog/my-year-in-2022/). Picking books I usually won't pick. (Read [The Unknown Unknown: Bookshops and the Delight of Not Getting What You Wanted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21913640-the-unknown-unknown) if you want to be similarly inspired.)

So here are 4 approaches I'm adding to my process.

1. **Algorithmic**. Sort [Kaggle books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m) based on popularity, rating, and age. Pick the top 10 (or 50)
2. **Serendipitous**. Go to bookstores and libraries. Pick the most popular books
3. **Award-winning**. Pick from the [Pulitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize), [Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_Prize), [Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature), [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award), and other [award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_literary_awards) winners
4. **Challenges**. Pick from [Popsugar](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/reading-challenge-2023-49013480), [Book Riot](https://bookriot.com/read-harder-2023/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/genres/reading-challenge-2023), [The 52 Book Club](https://www.the52book.club/2023-reading-challenge/), and other [challenges](https://www.girlxoxo.com/the-2023-master-list-of-reading-challenges/)

FYI, here are algorithmic results (for books with 100+ ratings and a 4+ average on Goodreads):
