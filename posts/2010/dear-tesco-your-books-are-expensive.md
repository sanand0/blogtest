Dear Tesco,

I do like you. Really. Your products are invariably cheaper than I can find at most other places. I am a [methodical](/blog/how-i-buy-gadgets), [crazy](/blog/lazy-bargain-hunting) [gadget](/blog/my-fuji-finepix-s5600) [freak](/blog/gadgets), and I find your gadget pricing impressive. I don’t always find what I want, but you often have the items I finally pick as the best value for money, and at very low prices.

But.

Your books are expensive.

Of [Amazon’s bestsellers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bestsellers/books), _just 2 out of the 100 books are cheaper_ on [your site](http://www.tesco.com/books/). And this is apart from the fact that I’d get free delivery from Amazon on 37 of those books (over £5), while you’d give me free delivery on 5 (over £15).

On average, that book list costs £5.66 on Amazon. With you, it’s £7.20. I don’t fancy paying 27% more. (36% if I include delivery.)

I’m not making this up. You can check: the books in red are cheaper at Amazon.
(as of 6pm on a cold, rainy Tuesday the end of March.)
