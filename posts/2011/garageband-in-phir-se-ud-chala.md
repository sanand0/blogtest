A month ago, I was at the [theatre](http://www.myvue.com/home/cinema/stratford) watching [Ra.One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra.One). The movie was [terrible](http://www.thevigilidiot.com/2011/10/28/ra-one/), yet enjoyable. But I’m going to talk about something else – a song I heard that caught my imagination.

The song is Phir Se Ud Chala from [Rockstar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_(2011_film)). Around 14 seconds into the video, you’ll hear a guitar start off at the background. That’s what caught my ear first – because I’d heard it before. Listen to this piece below:

I’d created this a couple of months ago with [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/) on my iPad2. It just plays two Apple Loops one after another.

The first one that you hear – Cheerful Mandolin 07 – is exactly the same background music that you hear in Phir Se Ud Chala. Guess A R Rahman uses GarageBand too!

(The strange thing is, I found no mention of this anywhere on the internet, as of 2 Dec 2011. Thought I’d have a go and be the first… just in case someone searches for Apple Loops or GarageBand in Phir Se Ud Chala from Rockstar.)

  The second loop is from Shauk Hai (Guru). Is this an Apple loop too?
- **Dinakaran** _3 Dec 2011 4:21 pm_:
  It could be that GarageBand came out as a product out of Logic Pro that ARR is using with similar sounds ?
