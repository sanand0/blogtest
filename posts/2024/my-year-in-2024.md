Here's the report card for my [2024 resolutions](/blog/my-year-in-2023/):

- **Compound long-term goals, daily**. PASS. I managed to work continuously build on 6 areas in 2024:
  - **Blogging** about 50 posts on my [blog](https://s-anand.net/) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanand0/)
  - **Weekly notes** of [things I learned](/blog/my-learnings-as-week-notes/)
  - **Teaching** [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) ([repo](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public))
  - **Reading** _only_ [Manga](/blog/books-in-2024/)
  - **Experimenting** with [LLM applications](https://solutions.straive.app/)
  - **LLM Evangelization** through [LLM Foundry](https://llmfoundry.straive.com/), Straive's LLM portal.
- **Hit 80 heart points, daily**. FAIL. I stopped exercise in the second half and gained 7 kgs.
- **Be a better husband**. PASS. My wife confirmed that I was "definitely worse in 2023 than 2024."

My most memorable events in 2024 were:

- [Declaring myself the world's first and only LLM psychologist](https://youtu.be/UniihAkwvLs?t=977)
- Evaluating 600+ real-life projects with LLMs ([project](/blog/introducing-students-to-ai-evaluators/), [hacks](/blog/a-post-mortem-of-hacking-automated-project-evaluation/), [analysis](/blog/when-and-how-to-copy-assignments/))
- [Creating my own Calvin & Hobbes strips](/blog/image-generation-gets-better-at-comics/)

I also turned 50. (It felt no different.)

In 2025, at my daughter's nudge, I'll play Goals Bingo instead, That is, complete one row or column here:

| Domain     | Repeat           | Stretch                                         | New                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| People     | Better husband   | Meet all first cousins <br>Interview 10 experts | Live with a stranger                    |
| Education  | 50 books         | Teach 5,000 students                            | Run a course only with AI               |
| Technology | 20 data stories  | LLM Foundry: 5K MaU                             | Build a robot <br>Co-present with an AI |
| Health     | 300 days of yoga | 80 heart points/day <br>Bike 1,000 km           | Vipassana                               |
| Wealth     | Buy low          | Beat inflation 5%                               | Donate $10K <br>Fund a startup          |

- Some goals are **Repeat**s - something I’ve done at least once before
- Some are **Stretch goals -** things I've been doing, but at a bigger scale
- Some goals are **New** things I’ve never done or even tried before

I won't try them _all_. I'll try to cross off one row or column and compound any one aspect.

**What are YOUR plans?**
