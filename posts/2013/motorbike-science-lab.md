My cousin’s working on an interesting project at the [Agastya Foundation](http://www.agastya.org/). A group of scientifically inclined volunteers go around on a bike to schools, taking with them a science lab kit, and show children in rural schools a variety of experiments.

Google will award this and 3 other projects (out of 10) Rs 3 crores based on public votes.
