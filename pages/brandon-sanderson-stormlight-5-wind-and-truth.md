## Prologue

https://chatgpt.com/c/68f216a3-e740-8323-a197-59ba257dc6b2

- Gavilar saw ALL 9 Honorblades!
  - So, BEFORE one was stolen? No, it was a vision.
  - Interesting... I thought Nale had his Honorblade. He might not?
- Gavilar spoke with the Stormfather!?
  - ... who wanted him to be his champion!?
  - ... and assumed he'd take Taln's place after returning from Braize
  - #Q There are words to become a herald? #ANS No, it comes from the Oathpact
  - #Q Stormfather probably has tried / had several champions before? #ANS No
- Gavilar is quite a manipulator!
- Kelsier
  - Uses Seons to communicate across planets
  - #Q ... is spiked in one eye!? #ANS Maybe iron/steel hemalurgical spike
  - #Q ... wants to transport stormlight. Why? #ANS To reduce local shard dependency for operations.
- Nale is the Makabaki accompanying Kelek.
- #Q Kelek caused the recreance!? "I made them ... go wrong ..."? #ANS No
- #Q What did Kelek do, then? “Before … I made them … go wrong …” #ANS Restoring voidbringers. Betraying Ba-Ado-Mishram.
- Ba-Ado-Mishram can grant forms. #Q Kelsier wants that secret? #ANS Kelsier wants investiture delinked from shards. Ba-Ado-Mishram did _exactly_ that.
- #Q Who is Axindweth, the off-world scholar Gavilar worked with? #ANS Terris ferruchemist worldhopper, maybe Set
- Gavilar (and Amaram) used gemstones in aluminum boxes to move voidspren (and voidlight) between realms. #Q How exactly did that trigger the return of the voidbringers? #ANS It didn't. It was too small a volume of light to matter. Axindweth and Ulim triggered the return using stormforms to sing the Everstorm into being.
- Ba-Ado-Mishram tried to replace Odium, give Voidbringer powers, was captured by radiants, and parshmen were created.
- Gavilar knew Vasher as Vasher!
- "My experiment was a success. I have the weapon." Gavilar had anti-voidlight. Vasher figured out how to make it.
- Taravangian met Gavilar before his death. Before visiting Cultivation.
- Taravangian's mother spoke a death rattle mentioning the Everstorm.
- #Q Which herald died the night Gavilar died? Chana? Did THAT trigger the Oathpact breaking? #ANS Maybe Chana (at Shallan's hands!?) but Jezrien's death is what broke the Oathpact.
- #Q Did Taln break? Or was it Chana's death and her breaking that brought them back? #ANS Taln didn't break. It wasn't a Herald's death either. It was the Everstorm.
- Gavilar was giving the anti-voidlight stone and message to the Stormfather, not Szeth.
- The initials of the The Stormlight Archive books are symmetrical: TWoK WoR O RoW KoWT
