## Gentle Persuasion

https://gemini.google.com/u/2/app/7cefc8a1b9a999e3

- Marshall Rosenberg (Nonviolent Communication): He strips language of all moralistic judgment and diagnosis, forcing the reader (and speaker) to focus entirely on universal human needs and feelings, which makes defensiveness biologically impossible.
- Daryl Davis (Accidental Courtesy). He recounts his experiences befriending KKK members not with arguments, but with the radical, disarming question: "How can you hate me when you don't even know me?"
- Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People). He writes with a pragmatic, folksy warmth that frames agreement not as a battle of logic, but as a byproduct of making the other person feel important, understood, and liked.
- Krista Tippett (On Being). Her interviewing style is a masterclass in "generous listening," where she uses soft, open-ended questions to let guests trace the genealogy of their own beliefs, often surprising themselves with what they say.
- Carl Sagan (The Demon-Haunted World). He blends rigorous skepticism with a spiritual-like wonder, writing about the universe in a way that makes the reader feel small enough to let go of their ego, yet significant enough to want to know the truth.
- David McRaney (How Minds Change). He uses a compassionate, journalistic style to deconstruct cognitive biases, framing delusions not as stupidity but as a shared, quirky human condition we can laugh about together.
- Oliver Sacks (The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat). He approaches the most broken and bizarre human conditions not with clinical detachment, but with a "romantic science" that treats every patient as a complete, dignified soul.
- Jonathan Haidt (The Righteous Mind). He uses moral psychology to act as an interpreter between political tribes, explaining the "why" behind opposing beliefs so that they appear rational rather than evil.
- Adam Grant (Think Again): His writing feels like a collaboration with the reader, using humility and scientific curiosity to normalize the act of "unlearning" as a strength rather than a weakness. Think Again explicitly advocates for the joy of being wrong; his tone is curious rather than corrective.

## Visual Data Art

https://gemini.google.com/u/2/app/f9fc55a95d6fecaf

- Flow Fields: Silky, sweeping, painterly lines that look like combed fur, topographic maps, or river currents. Uses a grid of invisible vectors (arrows) to guide the path of drawing agents, simulating fluid dynamics. E.g. Tyler Hobbs. _Fidenza_ — A series that feels like a perfect hybrid of computer precision and abstract expressionist painting.
- Reaction-Diffusion: Psychedelic animal print, brain coral textures, and fingerprint-like mazes that morph and breathe. Simulates chemical chemicals diffusing and reacting to create complex, self-organizing patterns (Turing patterns). E.g. Jonathan McCabe. _Multi-Scale Turing Patterns_ — Hypnotic, colorful, microscopic-looking textures.
- Physarum (Slime Mold) Simulation: Ghostly, veiny networks that look like fungal roots or city traffic seen from space. Mimics the behavior of _Physarum polycephalum_ (slime mold) foraging for food, creating efficient transport networks. E.g. Sage Jenson. _Ceres_ — A digital simulation where millions of particles form organic, breathing vascular structures.
- Swarm & Flocking (Boids): Murmurations of starlings, schools of fish, or particles moving in synchronized, liquid chaos. Emergent complexity arises from simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. E.g. Robert Hodgin. _Flight Patterns_ — Visualizations of air traffic data that look like glowing, living organisms.
- L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems): Fractal trees, alien ferns, and recursive branching structures. Uses a grammar of string rewriting rules to model biological growth processes like plant branching. E.g. Jon McCormack. _Fifty Sisters_ — Evolved digital plant species generated from code, presented as botanical illustrations.
- Pixel Sorting: Melty, dripping streaks of color where an image looks like it's sliding off the canvas. Reorders the pixels of an image based on brightness or hue, treating image data as a list of numbers to be organized. E.g. Kim Asendorf. _Mountain Tour_ — The project that popularized the "pixel sort" aesthetic, turning landscapes into digital waterfalls.
- Datamoshing: Surreal, smeared transitions where one video frame "melts" into the next, often leaving artifacts of the previous scene. Exploits video compression errors (specifically removing I-frames) to force motion from one clip to carry the pixels of another. E.g. Takeshi Murata. _Monster Movie_ — A video work that turns a B-movie monster into a pulsating, liquid abstraction.
- Dithering (Algorithmic 1-Bit): Retro, grainy, noisy textures composed entirely of black and white dots (or limited palettes). Exploring how to represent continuous tone using only binary states (on/off), often finding beauty in the "noise" of error diffusion. E.g. Dmitry Morozov. _Ra_ — Uses 1-bit dithering aesthetics in hardware installations to visualize sound and laser scans.
- Feedback Loops (Video Feedback): Infinite tunnels, liquid trails, and "hall of mirrors" effects that drip and echo. Feeding the output of a system back into its input, creating self-perpetuating, chaotic, and often uncontrollable results. E.g. Andrei Jay. _Waaave Pool_ — A video synthesis tool that creates melting, retro-psychedelic visuals using digital feedback.
- Ray Marching (SDFs): Smooth, plastic-like, infinite 3D landscapes that morph continuously; often looks "squishy" or mathematically perfect. Renders scenes by "marching" rays forward until they hit a mathematically defined distance field, allowing for infinite detail without polygons. E.g. Inigo Quilez. _Elevated_ — A 4KB intro (program) that generates a photorealistic mountain range from pure math in real-time.
- Strange Attractors: Wispy, fine-line tornados or glowing wireframe butterflies orbiting invisible points in space. Visualizes chaotic systems where a point orbits a specific set of values (the attractor) but never exactly repeats the same path. E.g. Dimitris Ladopoulos (Chaotic Atmosphere). _Attractors_ — High-definition renderings of mathematical equations that look like exquisite digital jewelry.
- Mandelbulbs (3D Fractals): Infinite alien cathedrals, H.R. Giger-esque tunnels, and hyper-detailed geometric caverns. Extends the 2D Mandelbrot set into 3D space, creating structures with infinite complexity at any zoom level. E.g. Tom Beddard (subblue). _Fabergé Fractals_ — Intricate, ornate 3D fractals that resemble alien artifacts or baroque architecture.
- Circle Packing: Bubbles, cellular structures, or pebbles filling a container perfectly without overlapping. The algorithmic challenge of fitting the maximum number of non-overlapping circles (or shapes) into a defined boundary. E.g. Julien Gachadoat. _Voronoi / Packing Studies_ — Minimalist plotter drawings where thousands of tiny circles form larger shapes or gradients.
- Voronoi & Delaunay (Generative Low Poly): Shard-like, crystalline, faceted structures that look like stained glass or crumpled paper. Partitions a plane based on distance to points (Voronoi) or connects points into triangles (Delaunay) to reconstruct forms. E.g. Raven Kwok. _1194D_ — An interactive creature made of subdividing tetrahedrons that explode and reform.
- Isometric Generative: Impossible architecture, endless staircases, and tumbling geometric blocks in a 2.5D orthographic view. Uses a grid-based isometric projection to create optical illusions or dense structural compositions without perspective distortion. E.g. Manolo Gamboa Naon. _Mantissa_ — Vibrant, dense compositions of overlapping geometric forms that feel like futuristic blueprints.
- Generative Plotter Art: Minimalist, high-contrast, pen-on-paper, "shaky" lines, moiré patterns. Writing code specifically to be drawn by a robotic arm (pen plotter), embracing the friction and ink bleed of the physical world. E.g. Vera Molnár. _Structure de Quadrilatères_ — Simple squares slightly offset by random algorithms to investigate the line between order and chaos.
- ASCII / PETSCII Art: Images constructed entirely from text characters, looking like "The Matrix" code or vintage terminal displays. Using the density of typographic characters (glyph brightness) to represent light and shadow. E.g. Kenneth Knowlton. _Studies in Perception I_ — An iconic nude portrait made entirely of computer symbols, one of the earliest digital artworks.
- Vector Synthesis (Oscilloscope Art): Glowing green neon lines, lissajous knots, and shapes that vibrate and twist with sound. Using audio signals to drive the X and Y deflection of an electron beam on an analog oscilloscope—you are literally "seeing" the sound. E.g. Jerobeam Fenderson. _Oscilloscope Music_ — Music videos where the audio waveform draws 3D shapes (mushrooms, butterflies) on the screen.
- Demoscene (4k Intros): Flashy, high-speed, techno-futuristic 3D graphics that push hardware to the limit. Extreme efficiency; creating a full audiovisual experience (music + video) in an impossibly small file size (e.g., 4096 bytes). E.g. Farbrausch. _fr-08: .the .product_ — A seminal 64kb intro that generated an entire 3D world and soundtrack from a file smaller than a JPEG.
- Subdivision / Computational Architecture: Gothic, bone-like, incredibly detailed columns and grottos that look grown rather than built. Recursively dividing simple shapes into smaller, more detailed versions of themselves (folding) to create massive surface complexity. E.g. Michael Hansmeyer. _Digital Grotesque_ — A 3D-printed room so detailed it contains millions of unique facets, generated by subdivision algorithms.
- Asemic Writing (Generative): Alien scripts, calligraphy that means nothing, sprawling glyphs that look like ancient manuscripts. Generating text-like forms that have no semantic meaning, focusing purely on the aesthetic of written language. E.g. Xu Bing / Tim Gaze. _A Book from the Sky_ — While hand-carved, it is the foundational conceptual work for this style; modern versions generate these glyphs with AI/code.
- Slit-Scan / Time Displacement: Stretched, jelly-like distortions where moving objects look like long, twisted tubes. visualizing time as space by capturing a single sliver of a video frame over and over and stacking them horizontally. E.g. Adam Magyar. _Stainless_ — High-speed subway trains captured through a slit-scan, making the busy commuters look like frozen statues in a void.
- Cellular Automata: Pixelated "critters" moving on a grid, expanding crystals, and retro-arcade textures. Discrete models where the state of a cell depends on the state of its neighbors (e.g., Conway's Game of Life), creating complex behavior from simple rules. E.g. Maxime Causeret. _Order from Chaos_ — A video visualizing cellular automata rules that evolve from simple dots into complex, organism-like colonies.
- Live Coding (Algorave): Cyberpunk, flashing code overlaid on top of the visuals it is creating in real-time. Showing the "seams" of the art; the code is the interface and the art simultaneously, written live in front of an audience. E.g. Olivia Jack. _Hydra_ — A live-coding video synth that runs in the browser, allowing for glitchy, feedback-heavy visuals created by typing code on the fly.
- Wave Function Collapse: Pixel-art cities that assemble themselves, pipes that always connect perfectly, procedural dungeons. An algorithm that fills a grid by determining which tiles _can_ exist next to each other based on a set of constraints, solving the "puzzle" of the image. marian42 (Marian Kleineber). E.g. _Infinite City_ — A procedural city generator that creates endless, logical, navigable 3D structures.
