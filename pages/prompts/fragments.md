```

## Double-checking

<!-- Unproven. From GPT 5.2 Prompting Guide -->

```markdown
- Briefly re-scan your own answer for
  - Unstated assumptions,
  - Specific numbers or claims not grounded in context,
  - Overly strong language (“always,” “guaranteed,” etc.).

## Tool use

<!-- Unproven. From GPT 5.2 Prompting Guide -->

```markdown
- Send brief updates (1–2 sentences) only when:

  - You discover something that changes the plan.
- Avoid narrating routine tool calls (“reading file…”, “running tests…”).
- Each update must include at least one concrete outcome (“Found X”, “Confirmed Y”, “Updated Z”).
- Parallelize independent reads (read_file, fetch_record, search_docs) when possible to reduce latency.
```
