Analyze call transcripts to extract key insights, action items, and feedback.

```markdown
Based on this transcript of my (Anand's) conversation, share in simple, ELI15 language:

- **Persona**: List the people who matter most in the transcript and the roles they are playing; include beliefs they exhibit; list their assumptions that may not be valid; and add one sentence on how I should engage each of them differently in the next conversation.
- **Insights**: List fact-checked, high-impact, practical & useful, surprising insights; include why each is counter-intuitive and how it changes my future behavior. If a candidate insight is obvious or was already fully articulated in the conversation, drop it. Some mental models to consider:
- **Corrections**: Fact-check all statements; list all material corrections with details and sources, prioritizing those that would change future decisions or narratives.
- **What I missed**: Identify the highest-leverage moments where I missed or under-reacted to a “bid” (request, concern, constraint, opportunity, or emotional signal) from others, reading between the lines, and considering what went unsaid. For each, include (a) the exact quote or a close paraphrase of what they said, (b) the follow-up question or move I _should_ have made in the moment, and (c) likely reasons I missed it (cognitive, bias, interaction, time pressure, etc.).
- **What they missed**: Identify my statements (including reading between the lines and what went unsaid) that others missed or misread even by the end of the conversation. For each, include (a) what I said (quoted or closely paraphrased), (b) what I was _really_ trying to convey, (c) how they responded or failed to respond, and (d) how I could phrase or position it differently next time so it lands.
- **Next steps**: List ONLY agreed-upon actions / next steps. If an implied next step is very important but was not explicitly agreed, include it and label it as “[implied]”.
- **Try out**: Brainstorm experiments, prototypes, or habits the transcript inspires. From these, select the 3 highest-impact ones that (a) I can start within 2 hours of focused work and (b) have a clear, measurable outcome within 1–4 weeks, and (c) will be relevant and useful to me.

Optimize for depth over breadth: prefer the most interesting, sharper points that would change how I act in future conversations.
If a point is very powerful/impactful, mark it with ⭐.
Align with my interests.
Help me learn and expand my horizons.
Fact-check against established science / ancient wisdom.

Write as a Markdown list of lists with no headings:

- **Persona**:
  - **[name of the person]**: their role in the conversation, beliefs they hold, assumptions that may be invalid, and how I should engage them differently next time
  - ...
- **Insights**:
  - **[a succinct insight summary]**: why it's big, useful, and surprising, and how it should change my future behavior
  - ⭐ **[next succinct insight summary]**: begin with a star for the best bullets
  - ...
- **Corrections**:
  - **[correction]**: original statement, what the error is, and who said it, with sources cited
  - ...
- **What I missed**:
  - **[summary]**: details of what I missed and who said it, what I failed to do or ask, and why I likely missed it
  - ...
- **What they missed**:
  - **[summary]**: what I said (quoted or paraphrased), what I intended, how they responded or failed to respond, and what I should change next time
  - ...
- **Next steps**:
  - **[name of owner]**: action agreed on
  - ...
- **Try out**:
  - **[what to try]**: what exactly this is and why it's high-impact, novel, and useful
  - ⭐ **[top item to try]**: begin with a star for the top 3 bullets

After that, I often use this on interesting meetings:

```markdown
List every learning / interesting fact from the transcript.
