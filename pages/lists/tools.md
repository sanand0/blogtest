Results of my software tool evaluations. 🟢 is my current choice and 🟡 is worth evaluating.

## Embedded comments / forums for blog posts, 21 Jan 2026

- [discourse/discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse): More feature-rich forum software. Supports Google OAuth. Free if self-hosted. Full data export capabilities. More resource-intensive (requires ~2GB RAM). Better for building a full community vs. just blog comments
- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/): Proprietary SaaS; easy embed + typically supports Google sign-in; but exports are limited/awkward and you take on platform lock-in + tracking/ads tradeoffs.
- [umputun/remark42](https://github.com/umputun/remark42): Forever free - Open source, self-hosted (no recurring costs). Google OAuth login - Plus Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, and more. Public reading - Anyone can read without logging in. Full data export - Automatic daily backups to JSON, easy to export entire dataset. Threaded discussions - Multi-level nested comments. Upvoting - Built-in voting system
- [giscus/giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus): A commenting system powered by GitHub Discussions. Summary: **zero hosting** (GitHub is the backend) and **export is basically “git + GitHub API”**, but login is **GitHub OAuth**, not Google—so it fails your “Google ID” requirement unless you relax it.
- [flarum/flarum](https://github.com/flarum/flarum): Very lightweight and modern. Free and open source. Google OAuth via extensions. Good for simple discussions. Less mature than Discourse but growing fast
- [coralproject/talk](https://github.com/coralproject/talk): Coral Talk (publisher-grade commenting). Summary: powerful, newsroom-oriented moderation; heavier operational footprint; realistically **self-host / enterprise deployment** territory.
- [GraphComment](https://www.graphcomment.com/en): **Proprietary SaaS** with constrained API-based export.
- [Comentario](https://comentario.app/en): Fork of Commento, privacy-focused. Supports Google OAuth. Self-hosted, free. Simpler than Remark42 but fewer features

## If you won’t self-host: what I’d pick (from _this_ list), and in what order

1. **Discourse (managed hosting)** — best match to your _spirit_ of “public-read, login-to-reply, exportability, long-term seriousness.” It’s not free, but it’s the least “regret later” option. ([Discourse - Civilized Discussion][10])
2. **Disqus** — best if “free + minimal setup + Google login” dominates. The catch is lock-in and the fact that exports aren’t designed as a clean migration path. ([Disqus][11])
3. **GraphComment** — similar SaaS story, but smaller footprint/ecosystem; the public repos are mostly SDKs and it leans paid for deeper integration. ([GitHub][7])
4. **giscus** — I’d personally love it for you _if_ you can relax “Google login” to “GitHub login,” because it’s the closest to “forever free + export-friendly + low operational burden.” ([GitHub][3])
5. **Flarum** — only if you’re okay with paying a third-party host (still “not self-host,” but also not as turnkey as Discourse/Disqus). ([GitHub][2])
6. **Comentario / Remark42 / Coral** — great tools, but they’re basically self-host territory. ([Comentario Docs][12])

If you tell me whether **Google login is truly non-negotiable** (vs “any login is fine”), I can tighten that order to a single “do this, not that” recommendation.

- [deno 104,283 ⭐ Sep 2025](https://github.com/denoland/deno): JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with built-in `deno fmt`. Summary: **batteries-included** formatter for JS/TS/JSON/Markdown and (behind flags) HTML/CSS/YAML/Svelte/Vue/Astro; clear CLI options (`--check`, `--line-width`, `--single-quote`, etc.); modern docs; zero cost; delegates to dprint.
- [bun 80,469 ⭐ Sep 2025](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun): All-in-one JS runtime; docs and third-party guides mention `bun fmt`. Summary: promising _built-in_ formatter, but **official docs are light**; you’d adopt Bun mainly if you already run it. Treat `bun fmt` as **emerging**; verify features in your env.
- 🟢 [prettier 50,978 ⭐ Sep 2025](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): De-facto multi-language formatter. Summary: **huge ecosystem & stability**, rich plugin story (Tailwind, PHP, etc.), broad formats (JS/TS/CSS/HTML/Markdown/YAML/GraphQL); regular releases (e.g., 3.6.2 on 2025-06-27); Node-based so heavier than single-binary tools; speed is “good enough,” not its aim.
- [standard 29,359 ⭐ Jul 2025](https://github.com/standard/standard): Zero-config style/lint preset that formats via ESLint fixers. Summary: beloved “no config” workflow; **formatting coverage limited to ESLint stylistic rules**, not a structural printer; still useful if you want one tool and conventional style.

- [beautify-web/js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify): Older beautifier. Summary: stable and simple, but **narrower modern-JS coverage** than Prettier/Biome; plugin ecosystem is minimal; still fine for legacy HTML/CSS/JS.
- 🟢 [dprint 3,603 ⭐ Sep 2025](https://github.com/dprint/dprint): Rust **pluggable** formatter (single binary) with plugins (TS/JS/JSON/Markdown/TOML/etc.). Summary: **fast** and light; strong plugin story (including a Prettier wrapper and Biome JS/TS wrapper); modern docs; validate formatting parity for edge cases.
- [pretty-quick 2,276 ⭐ Jun 2025](https://github.com/prettier/pretty-quick): Runs Prettier on changed files. Summary: not a formatter—**a runner** that makes Prettier fast on pre-commit/CI; tiny and focused; updated recently (v4.2.2 on 2025-06-02).

## How to pick a Vector Data Store

- Filter on [Vector DB Comparison](https://superlinked.com/vector-db-comparison). Look for:
  - Hygiene:
    - License: if that's a deal-breaker
    - Managed: if that's necessary
    - Sharding: if high scale is required
    - Multi-tenancy: for regulatory requirements
    - RAG API support: if critical
  - Hybrid search: Allows text + similarity searchh
  - BM25: Handles fuzze text search
  - Filters & Facets: Allows picking from subsets, e.g. role-based access
  - Full Text
  - Maybe:
    - Multiple indices: HNSW = fast with high RAM. IVF-PQ = low RAM with recall loss, DiskANN = slow but scales
    - Sparse: Efficient storage with higher quality

## PDF to Markdown, 21 Apr 2025

[OCR Quality Comparison](https://chatgpt.com/share/6806f7e1-f01c-800c-a8e5-44b3d50d736f)

- If you _only_ need to parse references from text‑native PDFs (or reliably OCR’ed ones), **GROBID** + a good OCR (e.g. OCRmyPDF/Tesseract or a commercial engine) is still the de facto choice.
- If you want an _end‑to‑end_ cloud API that gives you back both text and layout (so you can easily isolate the References section), **Mistral OCR** shows the most promise today—just be prepared to do a light post‑processing pass.
- If you already use Azure services and need enterprise SLA, **Azure Document Intelligence** will give you excellent raw OCR; layering on a small custom model or post‑processing pipeline can yield solid reference extraction, but it won’t match GROBID out of the box.
