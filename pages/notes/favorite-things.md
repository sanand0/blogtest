Some things have a disproportionate ability to delight me.

- Spare underwear. Spare anything everywhere
- Long battery life
- Extra monitor everywhere
- Not being picky about food.
- Fasting - makes routine food tastier
- Lower weight. Feels good daily
- Kids. Eternal fun and joy
- Internet!! LLMs!!
- Warm people to be wrapped around
- Fantastic fiction
- Money! So much you don't have to worry
- Leftover food I can scrape
- Gifted chocolates or dry fruits!
- Pain killers after a tooth or ear ache
